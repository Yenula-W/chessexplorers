        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Chess Explorers exists to bring the lifelong benefits of chess to children in daycares
          and less fortunate communities, with no cost barrier.

        <h2 class="section-title">Why Chess?</h2>
        <p>
          Chess is more than a game. It teaches planning, patience, creativity, and resilience.
          For many kids—especially those in under-resourced neighborhoods or daycares—structured
          enrichment activities like chess are hard to access.
        </p>
        <p>
          By offering <strong>completely free</strong> lessons where kids already are, such as
          daycares and youth programs, we remove barriers and create welcoming spaces where every
          child can explore, learn, and grow.

            <h3>Access for All</h3>
            <p>
              Every child deserves access to enriching activities, regardless of income,
              background, or location. We bring chess directly to them.

              Our programs are led by dedicated student volunteers who design lessons,
              mentor younger players, and model leadership and kindness.
